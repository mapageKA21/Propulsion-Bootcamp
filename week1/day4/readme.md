# Week 1 - Day 4

Last day before the first assignment!

Today you will have to finish the Bricks project. Hopefully you will be able to play with it by the end of the day.

Maybe even upload it to the cloud and share it with your friends so that they can play with what you created during the first week of the bootcamp.

Today's lessons are:
- [Closures](closures.md)
- [Immediately Invoked Function Expression](iife.md)
- [Parameters and `arguments` of a function](arguments.md)
- [Upload to Github Pages](github_pages.md)

The second and last part of the project:
- [Bricks](bricks2.md)
