# Week 1 - Day 3

Yesterday you created a cool game. But let's face it, nobody will every play with it.

Today you will begin a two day project. The project is to build one of the coolest classic arcade games, Arkanoid.

Today's lessons are:
- [Objects in JS](objects.md)
- [HTML Canvas](canvas.md)
- [`this` and context](this.md)

The first part of the two day project:

- [Bricks](bricks1.md)
