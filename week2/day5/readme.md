# Zurich Times

The assignment today is to put together the projects from day 3 and day 4.

Remember to use and MVC pattern for the JS code.

**Slider**

The top Slider should be populated with Images and title from the Top Stories from the Home section of the NYT API.

**Grid**

The Grid at the bottom, after the Horizontal Scroll will be stories from whatever section you want.

Each of the Blocks in this Grid should have a button to add the story to the user's favorites.

**Horizontal Scroll**

The Horizontal Scroll will be the stories that the user has selected as favorites from the Grid.

### Bonus

- Remove Favorites. Add a button to each favorite that will remove it.
- Add Title and Abstract to the Slider.
- You could also add favorite stories from the slider.
- Add a filter feature for the Grid. Right about it, add a dropdown with a few section and filter according the the selected one.
