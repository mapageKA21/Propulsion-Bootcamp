# Snake!!

In this project you are going to create the classic Snake game.

You can use the same grid as in the previous DOM manipulation projects. However, it is recommended that the grid is bigger than 5x5.

There are no guided steps in this projects. Just a few tips. Good luck!

**First tip**

The snake is a list of selected cells. Identify the head with another color.

**Second tip**

The movement is a mix between the previous projects.

There is a `setInterval` that updates the position of the cells.

Try to apply a snake that moves without interaction of the user first.

**Third tip**

Not all the cells in the snake are moving in the same direction at a specific moment.

When changing direction, first it moves the head up, but the rest of the cells keep their previous directions until they reach where the head moved up.

**Fourth tip**

Have a state of the direction of each cell.

When a key is pressed, it should change the direction of the head.

In the `setInterval` you the direction of a cell should be updated with the direction of the cell in front of it.

**Good luck!!**

**Do not hesitate to ask for help when needed!**
