# Advanced HTML

HTML5 is just the fifth version of HTML. It addressed some compatibility issues among browsers and added more support for multimedia on mobile devices.

HTML is the markup language where we add the content of our web apps. Using the tags we can add the content to the page.

Each tag is usually use for some specific purpose. Even though in the end any tag can be used for almost any purpose, is good to keep the tag for the purpose it was intended.

For example, using `<h1>` for a heading rather than a `<p>` with some styling.

Some of the most common new HTML tags are:

- `<article>`. Represents a self contained composition
- `<section>`. Represents a generic section, grouping related content together.
- `<nav>`. Represents a section with links to other parts of the application.
- `<header>`. Represents introductory or navigation information.
- `<main>`. Represents the main content of the body.
- `<footer>`. Represents the footer for the section. Usually author, copyright or related documents.

For further information take a look at the huge list on [MDN HTML Element Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element).

Using the proper tags help the web on accessibility for impaired users.
