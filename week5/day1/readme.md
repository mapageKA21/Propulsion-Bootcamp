# Week 5 - Day 1

I hope you had a great weekend and are full of energy for this Advanced JS week.

This week we will start using Javascript Libraries using the most popular Javascript package manager: **npm**.

In Javascript, in the server environment we have **node** and **npm**. We will be playing mostly with that during this week.

Today's lesson cover:

- [Node and npm](node.md)
- [TDD](tdd.md)
- [Testing in JS](testing.md)

The projects for today will be:

- Write tests for all the exercises developed on week 1 - day 1. Try to be very scrupulous searching always for all the edge cases.

  Try to use some Node Package in your exercises. For example, use this [package](https://github.com/liaozhongwu/data-type) for type checking in `isString`, `isArray` and `areSameType`.

  Be as tricky as possible and try to make your implementations fail with edge cases. Choose the implementation of one of the pair. Then, the other person should try to implement the tests, so that some will fail. Then try to implement the solution.

- Go on with this [extra exercises](exercises.md) using TDD. Write first the test, them implement the solution.
- Apply tests to the [Restaurant](../../week1/day1/restaurant.md) exercise.
